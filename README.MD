# README GENERATOR README

    
## [Description](#description)
    
This README Generator makes it easier for a developer to create a README file for their project by answering a few questions about the project and where to store the created README.md file.
    
### Motivation
    
The Motivation for creating this application comes from the need of developers to be more efficient and effective when coding.
    
### Problems Solved 
    
Being able to focus more time on aspects of the coding process that demand more intellectual attention rather than on mindless and redundant activities allows the developer to be more productive.
    
### What I learned 
    
I learned many new coding concepts, File I/O, some npm skills, how to organize and set up a project for gorup development and how to make tools that I can utilize to be more productive.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
